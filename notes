## **Kafka & Event-Driven Architecture — Quick Note**

### **Core Idea**

> **Producer** sends events → **Kafka stores in topics** → **Consumers** subscribed to those topics automatically get the events.

---

### **How It Works**

1. **Producer**

   * Creates an **event** (data) and sends it to **Kafka**.
   * Example: `"OrderPlaced"`, `"PhotoUploaded"`, `"UserSignedUp"`.

2. **Kafka Topic**

   * Like a **named mailbox** (e.g., `"orders"`, `"notifications"`).
   * Kafka stores events in order and can deliver them to many consumers.

3. **Consumer**

   * Already **subscribed** to a topic.
   * Automatically **receives events** as soon as they are sent to that topic.
   * Runs code to process the event.

---

### **Key Points to Remember**

* **Producer & consumer don’t know each other** — they only know the topic name.
* **Loose coupling** = services work independently.
* **Multiple consumers** can get the same event at the same time.
* Events can be **replayed** if needed.
* Use **groups** to balance load between multiple consumers doing the same work.

### **Real-World Uses**

* Notifications (Facebook likes, comments)
* Order processing (Amazon, Flipkart)
* Real-time dashboards (YouTube views, stock trading)
* Background processing (video encoding, image compression)
* Log aggregation (Netflix, Uber)

### **Analogy**

* **Topic** = WhatsApp group.
* **Producer** = Person sending a message.
* **Consumer** = Everyone in the group — all receive the message instantly.

---

### **Why Use It**

* Scale without breaking existing code.
* Process things in real-time.
* Add new services easily without touching existing ones.
